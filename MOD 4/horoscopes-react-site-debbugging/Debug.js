const testString = "Children are taught, often at a very young age, not to step over a scorpion, otherwise it would instantly sting them with poison. People regard the Scorpio as somewhat similar in real life. You really should be careful while dealing with these folks. Scorpio females are often referred to as 'ice maidens', because of their natural ability to perfectly hide their own emotions. Scorpios are some of the most intense and emotionally powerful characters, perhaps more than any other zodiac sign. Their outward appearance is typically cool and unflinching in any given situation, but there is a quantum amount of emotional energy inside, which is just rushing to burst out. Scorpios are often equated to a dormant volcano, which can burst out at any given moment. And the person who is in front of them at that point of time, is really unlucky, my friend!Beneath their calm and composed exteriors, Scorpios are immensely forceful, and have amazing persistence and determination. They have a certain magnetic intensity about them, and are mysterious beings, which will often not let you what they truly are, until the very last moment when it is too late. They are socially very refined though, and can make good conversations at social gatherings, being thoughtful, reserved; yet intensely appealing just by the way they look at you. Their look is so penetrating that they can almost undress a person with their eyes! Given these traits, Scorpios are also very loyal as persons, and a Scorpio friend is someone whom you can always rely upon, in good times or bad. They always fight for what they feel is deserving, and will never let go an inch of anything without a fair fight.What most people feel is that a Scorpio needs to exercise a lot of self-restraint. The dangerous thing about Scorpios is that they are perfectly aware of their own nature, and they can use it either for great good or for great evil. Nothing can stop a Scorpio male/female if they wish to destroy their enemies, and they pursue this task with a single-minded determination. In short, the Scorpio has unimaginable tenacity and will power, far more than ordinary levels. When you talk to them and they do not feel very friendly towards you, they might look at you in such a way that makes you shiver! In their daily behavior, Scorpios 05 seem to be aloof from the center of activity, quite remote and withdrawn in their approach. Underneath, however, they are carefully watching the entire situation, and taking precautions if they have to. Additionally, Scorpios have a strong reasoning power and analytical bend of mind, things which make them successful in their professional spheres. Add to that magnetism and intensity, and you have a far greater chance of producing a genius.In the field of romantic ties, Scorpios are highly attractive people, despite their remote nature. They often can seduce a person by their very eyes, and dress to kill their mate. Their constant attempt to psychologically interpret others makes them very successful lovers. Moreover, their determination helps them to emotionally capture anyone they can lay their eyes on. Scorpio is the sign of sex, and these people can display an animal energy in bed. Sometimes, they can be perverted and eroticism rules their head and heart."
